# What is BoPro?
A website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to increase productivity.BoPro is a productivity booster site. The site has sections such as:

- Pomodoro timer
- To-Do list
- Text notes

# Technology
The site is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used Bootstrap framework. All code is publicly available in this repository. There is also a Dockerfile for Docker.

# How does it work?
The site saves all data locally. That is, your data is stored only on your device and only you can access it.

The site is made fully adaptive and looks good on all devices.

I also use Google Analytics to view site stats.
